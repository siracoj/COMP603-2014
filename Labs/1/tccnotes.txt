Lab 1:

Tiny C Compiler(TCC):

	Source code overview:

		Tokenization:
			tcc.h
				Contains "Token Management" function definitions
			tccpp.c
				Contains the token scanner for all basic types in the syntaxs(strings, floats, ints)
				uses buffers to hold the different types in syntax
		Parser:
			tccpp.c
				Contains asm code to parse numbers, strings, and eof chars

		Translation:
			i386-asm.c/i386-asm.h
				translates asm to c functions
			coff.h
				Holds identifiers for C basic types
		
		Optimization:
			tccelf.c
				Holds the symbol tree structure
			tcccoff.c
				sorts the symbol tree
		Code generation:
			arm-gen.c
			c67-gen.c
			i386-gen.c
			x86_64-gen.c
	
		



	Funny Comments/ Bad code:

		Lots of comments like "I guess this is used for relative short jumps..." or I guessed some of these assignments"
